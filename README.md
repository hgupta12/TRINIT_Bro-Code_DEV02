# Grasshopper
This is our submission to the TRINIT Hackathon 2022!

# About
Grasshopper is a bug tracking system that can prioritize bugs faced by your software team through the bug reports of users from all over the world who use your software . This helps to spot repetitive problems and concentrate on important issues. In addition to this, it improves the team's productivity and reduces the cost of development.
